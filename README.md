‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

After registration/login, a JWT token is stored and used for authentication.

Income and Expense transactions are CRUD operations connected to MongoDB.

Charts are generated dynamically based on the last 60 days of data.

ExcelJS is used to export a user's transaction history.

Axios is used for frontend-backend communication.
